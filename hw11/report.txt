ASCII vs netcdf

My brief comparison of ASCII vs netcdf. First, the runtime with netcdf is significantly
faster. With ASCII writeout, the code takes about 38s to run, but with netcdf writeout was 
nearly six times faster, averaging around 6.2s. The netcdf file is also much smaller, at 5.4K,
tiny compared to the 314M file produced by the ASCII writeout.
